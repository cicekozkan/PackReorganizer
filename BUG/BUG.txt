* DONE Engine keeps adding the profit in case of an error happened during close.
Add profit only if the order is successfully closed
* DONE Orders cannot be closed after the last change. Fix it and stop trying to close in case of an error
For now move to the next order after a certain times of trying. Run method will try closing the same order in the next tick
